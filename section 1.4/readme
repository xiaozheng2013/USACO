pack.cpp took me for a long time.
Actually, the time period for me to finish this is like 2 weeks, the actually time I spent on thinking and coding this is more than 5 hours or so.  Besides that I also reviewed several basic graph operations before coding it, which took me another 2-3 days.  At the beginning of this process, I felt very frustrated and doubted about my ability to handle coding. Later on, I gradually changed my mind and mentality, I understands that I am still new to coding area, and need more practice before I can really competes with any traditional cs students, and the only best thing I can do is to accumulate and practice all kinds of basic and fundamental problems, and improve my skills systematically and stably.
